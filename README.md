## Overview
The Inception project aims to create a fully functional containerized application using Docker. This project allowed me to explore the fundamentals of containerization, networking, and service orchestration.

## Some Features
- Dockerized Services: Create and manage multiple services using Docker.
- Docker Compose: Use Docker Compose to orchestrate multi-container applications.
- Configuration Management: Manage configuration files and environment variables.
- Networking: Understand and implement networking between containers.
- Data Persistence: Implement volume management for data persistence.
